AmazingRW| [> You can think he's a complete jerk who didn't deserve jail time.  And the courts agreed with that view.  This is what many people are mistaken about. Amos Yee was not originally handled a jail term. He was handled a probation sentence. The only reason he was in jail is that his father refused to bail him out (and he broke the bail conditions multiple times). He asked for a jail term in order to backdate the duration he spent under arrest. Doing so would completely avoid the need for probation.  The **decision to pursue a jail term was a deliberate and calculated attempt at maximising his benefits** since it is highly probable that he had little care about having a jail sentence on his records.](/r/singapore/comments/7mqdbb/amos_yee_supporters/drwd9mm/)|61|2017-12-29 14:15:20
hotgarbagecomics| [Not gonna lie, I had to look up what "strawman" meant.  The way I see it, the comic is specifically about Amos Yee supporters, and not the larger category of people who criticized the treatment meted out to him (which includes both supporters and detractors). I loosely modeled the 'supporters' characters on the HK activists who championed his cause in the early days of his arrest.](/r/singapore/comments/7mqdbb/amos_yee_supporters/drw24dp/)|20|2017-12-29 09:59:15

firewind555| [Omitting a massive chunk of info(court drama and some of the other stuff he did), here is my attempt at summarizing.   Background: Amos Yee is a former child actor (though you might disagree) who is known for his controversial views in his videos and posts.    In 2015: Shortly after the death of Former PM Lee Kuan Yew, he uploaded a video filled with expletives painting LKY as a 'power-hungry dictator' and his followers as 'foolish and blind.' He likened the both to Christianity as well. This drew the attention and ire of many Singaporeans who were in mourning of LKY at the time. 32 police reports were made against him because of this. He was arrested after, and despite being 16, was tried as an adult and sentenced to jail for 4 weeks. Lawyer could have helped him out but Amos back stabbed him. The jail sentence attracted the attention of international media, some who reported as is and some who supported Yee and attacked Singapore on its restriction of freedom of speech.    2016: Sentenced to jail for 6 weeks and fined $2000 after he did what was in the cartoon above. Jail time was at Tanah Merah, then home detention. Fled to US in Dec to seek asylum.   2017: Incarcerated in a US jail. Asylum granted in March but US gov appealed in April, so he was still held at Immigratuons and Customs. Asylum finally granted in September. Then you have his FB posts and here we are.](/r/singapore/comments/7mqdbb/amos_yee_supporters/drvyom6/)|19|2017-12-29 08:47:32

AmazingRW| [I do not think that you are willing to accept why Amos Yee has been hit with bail conditions, even when presented with valid reasons.   Civil disobedience is a moral concept, it has no legal significance. Moral or legal, to voluntarily suggest, and to pick an option (jail term in this case) means that one fully deserves the consequences. Amos Yee chose the jail term himself, who are you to judge his personal choice?   Where morals are concerned, I believe that, with a fair assessment of the situation, a majority of the Singapore residents would agree that Amos Yee was in the wrong. Morals are defined by the society, and this this case, Amos Yee's actions are wrong, both legally and morally. ](/r/singapore/comments/7mqdbb/amos_yee_supporters/drxyz7w/)|4|2017-12-30 13:45:48
dansbandsmannen| [> I do not think that you are willing to accept why Amos Yee has been hit with bail conditions, even when presented with valid reasons.   I do not consider his bail conditions to be reasonable. Anything that has followed is meaningless to discuss unless you can change my mind on that.  >Civil disobedience is a moral concept, it has no legal significance. Moral or legal, to voluntarily suggest, and to pick an option (jail term in this case) means that one fully deserves the consequences. Amos Yee chose the jail term himself, who are you to judge his personal choice?   Are you daft, but I guess I should thank you for arguing my point. His actions are those of moral question at best. The legal outcome is of no conversely of no moral value. The inconsistent laws of Singapore made his consistent, juvenile and most importantly harmless behaviour dictated that he had to be jailed is of no moral value.  If a child, or other intellectually undeveloped individual decides a jail sentence is for them, should we accept their judgement? Do you agree with him that we should let kids decide when they are ready for sex with adults too?  Unlike you I don't think that because he got jailed it proofs that he deserved it. I've learned to not shut my eyes and trust that the state knows what best in all situations.  >Where morals are concerned, I believe that, with a fair assessment of the situation, a majority of the Singapore residents would agree that Amos Yee was in the wrong. Morals are defined by the society, and this this case, Amos Yee's actions are wrong, both legally and morally.   They are not concerned anywhere as this is a question of free speech, and the morals are completely orthogonal to the values of the former.  If you look further than Singapore I think you will find that he gets more support in principle internationally than domestically.

Goobera| [It's a holiday event and debating its merits during the event as opposed to enjoying it creates unwanted friction. If you'd not debate the event during a christmas meetup, why would you do it on fb? If you've not seen the video, there is literally a picture of jesus holding a gun in it. I'm sure that is intended to educate and draw them to OP's side with no intention to offend.  If we take NYE as an example, there is literally nothing special apart from changing 2017 to 2018, it's just another day, just like your birthday. But talking about this just takes the fun away from it for everybody.  Just like the same way you wouldn't talk about a person's bad points at his funeral. There's a time and place for everything and basic tolerance goes a long way, especially in Singapore. Want a recent example? Look at Amos Yee.  Personally, I didn't think it needed much explanation at all. The merits of your argument hold 365 days a year, you can always pick another day to go about it. Is anyone really so deluded that they think a 15 minute video is going to magically turn a man of faith into a non-believer? Or that they wish to face the falsehood of their religion during their religious holiday? It's always the younger atheists, which lack social skills due to their immaturity, pushing for these arguments at the expense of everyone's happiness during christmas and it's annoying to everybody. Yes you're right, but you're also an asshole.](/r/singapore/comments/7lxt2k/rsingapore_random_discussion_and_small_questions/drqewzz/)|1|2017-12-25 15:45:32

CharAznia| [First off U are taking a very narrow approach to all this. Just because this particular protest did not inconvenience anyone does not mean future ones won't. I've experienced entire metro system in Paris not running for days. My excursion to the Palace of Vasillies never happened because the staff decided to go on strike that day. I've many colleagues in London who had to spend all their annual leave at home taking care of kids because the teachers when on strike. I've been stuck in traffic for 4 hrs for a journey that should have lasted 45min because some clowns decided to hold their protest on the roads around the main plaza in Lima, Peru. That's just some of the things I've personally experienced, funny part is a lot of my foreign colleagues would love to have what we have here. Confining protest at a single location to minimize disruption  2nd, I said laws are subjective however I did not say ALL of them are inappropriate for everyone. Just because some liberal rules work for the majority does not mean it works everywhere. The same liberal democracies that work so well in Europe failed miserably when imported into the middle east and Africa, not only did it not makes things better, it made things way worse. Implementation of laws and policy needs to take into account local culture and practices. We may disagree with the dictatorship like rulers in the middle east but those same dictators were keeping the terrorist in check. I'm not saying they should stay dictatorship forever however the region is simply not ready for it and it should not have been forced upon them.   Closer to home, I am of the view that LGBT's much hated section 377a should be repealed. I am also in agreement with the govt that society at large isn't ready. Some things simply needs time to be resolved. I'm not saying we should ignore everything from the West, I'm saying we need to only learn from those that suits us.   Ur definition of progressive is extremely narrow. Ur idea of progressive is we have to follow the liberal west, the problem is you guys idea of the freedom enjoyed by the west is just as much an illusion. There are many things that is banned or illegal in the west which is totally against basic human rights but totally ok in SG. E.g. France ban wearing of the burqu. Or how about selective free speech, where promoting of Nazism is banned in Germany. U might also want to read this as well  https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/ali-abunimah/france-begins-jailing-people-ironic-comments  So why is it never mentioned and totally OK when they do it but when SG does it. OMFG human rights pitch forks out. The "Free Speech" that clowns like Amos Yee and Roy Ngerng promotes does not actually exist anywhere in the world  Third, it was an example, u are not suppose to take it literally. Let me make another example that might be more valid. Taking drugs like Heroin is illegal here. I disagree with the law. Does it mean I can start taking heroin? My point is just because U disagree with the law does not mean U are allowed to break it  Finally, 3 words. Graduate Mother Scheme.

topkek1993| [> And if I did do it, it **does not at all make sense** that legally, the 20-year-old that my 16-year-old self had sex with should go to prison for it  How does it not make sense? What is this "making sense" that Amos refers to, and with what evidence does he justify his stance?  >if a person **below the age of 18** **perfectly consents** to having sex  How far below the age of 18? Is Amos referring to a 17 year old? A 16 year old? A 13 year old? A 9 year old? Or possibly, a 5 year old?   What does "perfectly consents" mean? Let us assume that there will be a 5 year old child, out of the many 5 year old children, that will agree to having sex, based on bribery and persuasion. Is that considered "perfect consent"*? This is the same old argument for a minimum age of consent: that a immature child's mind can be exploited and manipulated by a mature mind. And this argument should hopefully be justified by the same evidence or sound, logical theories that Amos Yee lacks in his speech about "making sense". Advice from psychologists, moral and ethics academia, neuroscientists and other involved professionals should be sought - and Amos Yee has not sought such advice, nor availed himself of any knowledge thereof.  Harvard may not have cancelled his speech because of censorship issues, but because Amos' words may have displayed a lack of education (logic, critical thinking tools) that lead them to doubt his abilities to speak well in front of a Harvard audience. In fact, going by his words in the article, I will nix the "maybe" - Amos definitely lacks logic and critical thinking tools.  >And if I did do it, it does not at all make sense that legally, the 20-year-old that my 16-year-old self had sex with should go to prison for it?  Also, this sentence does not exhibit good grammar. At least not to me (caveat: I am not **good** at English).  All in all, Amos should lay off his Harvard speaking ambitions. ](/r/singapore/comments/7fdcfr/amos_yee_receives_death_threats_for_publicly/dqex98j/)|1|2017-11-28 01:58:13

AmazingRW| [First of all, there is the need to understand that expression freedom exists in various forms. The US' version of it is not necessarily beneficial for other countries. With the differences in culture, global standing, and environment between Singapore and the US a reality, why should Singapore blindly imitate the constitution of another country? This is a question worth considering.  Secondly, perfect expression freedom does not exist in this world. All forms of free speech are regulated, and restricted in ways varying from one country to the next. Germany for example, outlaws the denial of the holocaust that could "result in public disturbance" (much like the religious and race protection laws here). Violators of the law could be fined or jailed up to 5 years.  Now, tell me, does Germany come to mind when people discuss about the lack of free speech? It doesn't, because there is a cognitive bias in the ways the West and the East are commonly viewed with regard to democracy and freedom. The West is usually assumed to be more successful.  The US too, has anti-hate speech laws. The reason we do not know about it is due to the culture and politics (these laws are rarely enforced). American politicians rarely sue for defamation damages, because it is simply not in the US' culture (the US also has a different interpretation of defamation).  I have to correct the examples you have brought up. Amos Yee has never been sued by anybody, and Roy Ngerng was sued by Lee Hsien Loong, not the government. Roy Ngerng was sued because he spread false information that would damage another's repute. He was given a chance to remove the offending content, but was defiant and demonstrated no remorse. It was a civil case initiated by an individual, not the state.  Lastly, it is crucial to understand that expression freedom and defamation laws are not mutually exclusive. Expression freedom, in the legal and constitutional sense, does not extend to people the immunity from being demanded compensation should they defame or hurt others.  I would caution against being swept along by the wave of increasingly widespread US values. We should carefully pick the elements to adopt, choosing those that work for us, and avoid forcing those that do not on ourselves. The adoption of American values can be beneficial, provided that we are smart about it.](/r/singapore/comments/7ckj4u/free_speech/dpqomjf/)|24|2017-11-13 12:50:21
dravidan7| [its all in the mindset. not like every singaporean goes around suing others for defamation. only certain men in white.   even if libel laws werent that over the top. still got many ways and means to control critics.  roy ngnerg also got fired from his hospital job in such a weird manner in that moh made a statement supporting hospital over his termination. his dad's hawker stall got apparent surprise visit from nea over cleanliness.   amos yee got charged with wounding with religious feelings. subjected to mental evaluations at imh for no obvious reasons. as the judge who granted him asylum noted. others have made racist statements and did not get charged. like the pro pap jason neo and calvin cheng.   same for jbj. got charged for no good reason. fought his case all the way to privy court in uk and was found innocent. didnt help much in the end. the pap just abolished the laws allowing one to appeal to privy court.   the problem with free speech in SG is that the public do not care.   see the case in usa, when disney tried to blacklist a newspaper over critical news. the others in media backed the newspaper and got the blacklist overturned.   we dont need usa level of free speech where hate is allowed to flourish.   but if people here think free speech and human rights are somehow alien or some western trap, they are not going to stand up for it. and thus let it be abused. we dont have to see the example of lhl siblings to know that just cause you didnt see any use for certain laws now doesnt mean it wont be usefull in the future. which is why people need to support things like free speech/press even if they dont see an immediate need or benefit. ](/r/singapore/comments/7ckj4u/free_speech/dpqs1ue/)|-1|2017-11-13 14:28:57

bruindke| [What frustrates me the most about Amos Yee, and many other figures who are involved in this conversation, is that they all invoke free speech incorrectly. Our First Amendment rights protects us *from the government*. We have the right to hold opinions and criticize government policies and officials, and as long as we are doing it peacefully, the United States government has very little legal recourse.  Private institutions (which Harvard is) and public opinion are a whole different matter. Neither the First Amendment, nor the American value of free speech, were meant to protect you from consequences stemming from those non-governmental sources. The United States *never* defined free speech in those terms.  In other words, Amos Yee can say all he wants that age of consent is horse shit or Muslims and Christians are dickeaters. The US government can't do anything about it and private institutions, organizations, and the public can respond in any way they see fit (again, assuming full legality of the responses). So NO, Amos Yee and alt-right and whoever else is making this horse shit argument: Harvard rescinding this invitation is *not* an attack on free speech.](/r/singapore/comments/7cdbyx/harvard_event_with_amos_yee_cancelled/dppmp29/)|17|2017-11-13 00:40:51

I think a lot of us here do so, too. The old man was a great leader, but not exactly a good person (he believed in eugenics, for one). He knew the law, he was not afraid to use it. Hence why he sued so many people under his own name.  It's just that since we have been taught to correlate Old Man = Party = Country we have come to think that anything the old man (or LHL) does is on behalf of the state, and that it is a state action and not a private action taken by a private person.

Harvard probably wouldn't have invited a Westboro Baptist Church member who thinks gays should burn in hell, or a radical Islam theologist who thinks women should be kept in subjugated positions in society. A dude who thinks you should be able to sleep with a 10 year old if you convince the 10 year old that they're really consenting after all is probably on par with those in terms of the destructiveness of said beliefs.

They are well-known to have their students exposed to knowledge and affairs out of textbook curriculum (in other words, things that are "breakthrough" & unconventional).   I suspect political scholars may be very interested in Amos' actions thus far and in his subsequent decisions. Keep in mind that Americans consider what Amos went through as suppression of freedom of speech by the government - and for someone who has went through jail and oppression for that, I won't be surprised if some liberal arts student came up with a thesis on this whole Amos Yee saga.  That said, I obviously still don't agree with what Amos did.

Freedom of press is abysmal for a developed   U seem to be confusing a critique to baseless accusations. No one SG have ever gotten into trouble for the former(maybe in the LKY era they did but not since he stepped down). Just ask Catherine Lim. I love how the opposition supporters just love to spread their lies in the name of freedom of speech and cry censorship when they got caught out  So what if our media is directly owned by Temasek Holdings, haven't stopped them from criticizing the govt and occasionally promoting the opposition. Only those who have selective reading problems will claim those do not exist in our MSM. Furthermore  with the advent of the internet, there is nothing stopping other media from having different commentary. Case in point opposition propaganda website like TOC, TISG, etc. Ironically TOC and TISG mostly carry heavily censored version of the same articles U find in MSM yet those are the ones the pple claim are champions of free speech. The MSM do not practice political censorship they have a form of self censorship to ensure whatever they publish can be proven. Just because they are owned by TH have not stopped them from publishing pro-opposition/anti govt articles. You don't find too many of them simply because they do not publish things they cannot prove.   I standby my claim that there is no true political censorship in SG. U don't know what political censorship is until U've actually lived in an environment like China(I did). In SG when there is a clash or ideas, those ideas are debated upon in public, in print or in Parliament between our politicians and other stakeholders. In Countries with active political censorship, when there is a clash of ideas, U never knew there was one because they are never reported. Clearly it's not the case in SG. Maybe in the LKY era and early days of GCT era, but certainly not today  I do not deny that censorship of other topics can be politically motivated. One can debate if censoring certain content e.g. the Amos Yee anti-religious case is politically motivated(not sure how high U need to be to actually think the PAP head honchos was the one who wanted to bring down Amos). However I would like to point out that this kind of "censorship" happens all over the world including the US and EU. Why is it political censorship when it's done in SG but not when the US and EU does it.](/r/singapore/comments/7aovud/gay_pride_state_shame_in_singapore_asia_times/dpewinn/)|2|2017-11-06 13:35:51
